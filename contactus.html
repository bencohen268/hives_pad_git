CLICK READ MORE FOR A LIST OF SPECIFIC QUESTIONS.<\\\/p>\\r\\n<p>CSU encourages students to be cautious when signing an off-campus lease for the fall, not because of our local property management companies, but because changes to COVID-19, including a potential spike in the virus, could change what the university&rsquo;s fall semester looks like. When connecting with property managers, we recommend you ask the following questions to determine the flexibility of their lease before signing.<\\\/p>\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n<li>Do you provide a reasonable early buy out option in the lease? If yes, where is that language in the lease and how does your company apply it?<\\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Do you provide a flexible start date in the lease? If yes, where is that language in the lease and how does your company apply it? What contingencies trigger the change in start date and who has the power to trigger the option?<\\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Do you offer shorter term (less than a year) leases? What are my options? Academic leases? Nine or ten month? One semester? A custom length?<\\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Do you offers individual leases (rather than joint liability leases with co-tenants)?<\\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Will you assist in the search for replacement tenants in an assignment or sublet situation?<\\\/li>\\r\\n<li>Where is that written in the lease?<\\\/li>\\r\\n<\\\/ul>\\r\\n<p>We also strongly recommend you meet with&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\\\/\\\/sls.colostate.edu\\\/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Student Legal Services&nbsp;<\\\/a>for a free review of your lease before signing.
